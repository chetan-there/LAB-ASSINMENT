Program 1:
------------
Write a Program to perform sorting operation on Product class using ArrayList by implementing Comparable interface.

Create a BLC class Product.

Instance variables:
productNumber-private-Integer
productName-private-String
productPrice-private-Double

Create a parameterized constructor to initialize the instance variable of Product class.

Implement Comparable interface to write the logic to sort the Product class based on the Product Name.

Create an ELC class which contains main method, create ArrayList object to hold Product data as well as sort the product data object based on the product name.

Program 2:
------------
Write a Program to perform sorting operation on Customer class using 
ArrayList by implementing Comparator interface 

Create a BLC class Customer
Instance variables:
customerNumber-private-Integer
customerName-private-String
customerBill-private-Double

Create a parameterized constructor to initialize the instance variable of Customer class.

Implement Comparator interface to write the logic to sort the Customer class based on the following 
a) Based on customer number
b) Based on customer name
c) Based on customer bill
Create an ELC class which contains main method, create ArrayList object to hold Customer data as well as sort the Customer data object based on the above criteria
